Coupling
========

This is a web site that will automatically assign pairs for any given iteration.


Intended to make it quick and easy to pair off, and encourage people to pair with people who they haven't paired with in a while.

Have fun!


To install and run, you'll need to have mongo and node installed. Once you've got that...

1. Clone the Coupling repository.
2. In the Coupling directory, run the command "node app.js"
3. Now you can browse to the Coupling website in a browser at http://localhost:3000 to confirm it works.
4. If you get an error message telling you that mongo isn't working... start mongo.
